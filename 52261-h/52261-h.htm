<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>A Record
of St. Cybi&rsquo;s Church</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old Church of St. Cybi, at
Holyhead, which contains so many memorials of the devotion and
piety of former generations, has been in this Jubilee year of the
reign of Queen Victoria enriched by many precious gifts.&nbsp; A
new South Aisle, capable of containing 50 or 60 worshippers, has
been added to the Church as a memorial to Mr. and Mrs. W. O.
Stanley of Penrhos; and the beautiful window at the east end has
been placed there in memory of Mr. Watson, Chairman and Managing
Director of the City of Dublin Co., by his sons.</p>
<p>The connection of Mr. Stanley&rsquo;s forefathers, the Owens
of Penrhos, with the Church of St. Cybi, has been a very close
one, and we are indebted to the archaeological lore and love of
the locality which distinguished his family and himself, for the
preservation of many beautiful traditions and interesting remains
of long past ages.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Holyhead
Island is rich in old-world treasures which appeal not only to
the archaeologist and the historian, but to the artistic mind and
eye of men like Matthew Arnold and the author of &ldquo;The
Stones of Venice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just on the other side of the Mersey,&rdquo; Ruskin
writes, &ldquo;you have your Snowdon and your Menai Straits and
that mighty granite rock beyond the moors of Anglesea, splendid
in its heathery crest, and footplanted in the deep sea, once
thought of as sacred&mdash;a divine promontory, looking westward;
the Holy Head or Head Land, still not without awe when its red
light glares first through storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that same mountain of Holyhead are the circular hive-shaped
dwellings, of unknown antiquity, called locally &ldquo;Cyttiau
Gwyddelod,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Irishmen&rsquo;s Huts.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These are excavated to a depth of some feet below the surface, 15
feet to 20 feet in diameter inside, the sides of the interior
being lined with stones to prevent the earth from falling, and
the dome-shaped roof only being apparent above the surface of the
ground.&nbsp; In addition to the above are the curiously shaped
querns, mullers, and other stone implements indicating the past
life of the dwellers in these rude huts.</p>
<p>The great Cromlech at Trefignedd and the fine Monoliths at
Plas Meilw also bear silent record to the existence of men, who,
but for this lasting <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>evidence might well be deemed mythical.&nbsp; At that
great Cromlech, overlooking many miles of country, horrible
scenes were enacted, according to tradition, scenes too ghastly
for description; and now, cattle graze and children play in the
sunshine among those giant stones.</p>
<p>Holyhead mountain has repeatedly been a witness to fierce
struggles for mastery between the natives and invaders, who from
time to time landed, and tried to make good their footing, on
that wild picturesque coast, guarded as it is to the west by
jagged rocks, and with only here and there a creek into which a
boat might be pushed in calm weather.&nbsp; Even now, with all
the help that modern invention and careful thought can give,
there are tragic tales of shipwreck and loss of life on those
cruel rocks; and what must it have been in ancient times, when
there was nothing between daring men and death but their rough
boats, which it would take little to dash into a thousand
atoms?</p>
<p>Doubtless in those early days the island was wooded, as trunks
of trees are found at low tide, half buried in the sand in
Towyn-y-Capel Bay, on the west coast.&nbsp; Possibly, under cover
of these trees, marauders were able to effect a landing unseen;
but at present, when there is not a single stick or shrub of any
kind, this is difficult to realise.&nbsp; Still, though the trees
have perished, there remain the silent monuments of that great
race, which are <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>found in almost every land; the same cromlechs, the same
monoliths, as exist in our own island, are traceable on the
Continent of Europe, especially in Brittany, and even in remotest
India.</p>
<p>If to searchers after Druidical and Ante-Druidical remains
Holyhead affords such rich results, yet higher interest still
attaches to its early Christian records.&nbsp; In it, and in its
neighbour Anglesey, are traced some of the earliest evidences of
the foundation of the Christian Church, its collegiate bodies and
its organization; and from this cradle of the Church proceeded
the men whose teaching appears to have effectually superseded the
dying religion of the Sun and the Serpent; for we have evidence
that a number of Druid priests were converted, and we have no
record of any bitter animosity against the preachers of the
Gospel.</p>
<p>Early legends affirm that James, the son of Zebedee, came with
his mother Salome into Britain, six years after our Lord&rsquo;s
Ascension, and preached the Gospel to willing ears; others say
St. Paul himself visited these Islands after his imprisonment by
Nero.</p>
<p>How far these legends are literally true is not of great
consequence; the certainty remains that the Gospel was preached
throughout the country, and that the fabric of the holy Church
was raised and organized here after the same manner as the
Eastern Churches.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>As a
proof of Christians having visited the Island, a medal was found
in one of the Druid Mounds in Anglesey bearing the inscription,
&ldquo;This is Jesus Christ the Mediator,&rdquo; and as the
Romans had routed the Druids, this medal must have been there
before the demolishing of the mound by Suetonius Paulinus, thus
verifying in part the words of Tertullian an age later, who
relates the sudden progress of the Christian Faith, which
anticipated the Roman sword in the celerity of its conquests.</p>
<p>The first school of &ldquo;Christian learning&rdquo; to supply
the province with clergy was apparently founded at Bangor, Anno
Domini 182, and it is supposed that according to the usual plan
of organization there were seven bishops under an archbishop in
this province of Britain.&nbsp; Some of these were bishops of
endowed sees, others were consecrated &ldquo;Sine
Titulo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clergy in general appear to have lived with their bishops,
forming collegiate bodies, and they were sent out by their
superiors into various districts allotted to them as occasion
required.</p>
<p>It does not appear that they had any settled parishes in Mona
for many years after this period nor were there many churches;
but they &ldquo;assembled the people together to hear the Word of
God preached in some convenient place, either at oratories or at
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the
manor-houses of their respective Lords and Masters, who probably
had their own chapels for sacred use and service.&nbsp; Most of
these churches and chapels were dedicated to such early Christian
names as St. Mary, St. Peter, St. Michael, &amp;c.&rdquo; (see
&ldquo;Mona Antiqua.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>After the departure of the Romans in A.D. 390 the Picts tried
to regain their former possessions, and the country was sorely
ravaged by them until there stood up two families of eminent rank
who laid claim to the British Sceptre.&nbsp; The one was headed
by Octavius, grandson of the Duke of Cornwall; the other was
descended from Cynetha Weledig, and nearly related to Constantine
the Great.</p>
<p>For many years struggles continued between these rival
Princes; but at length the descendant of the Cornwall family gave
up the contest and retired to the Duchy of Cornwall.&nbsp;
Cynetha&rsquo;s descendants having routed the Picts who had
invaded Mona, made head also against the Saxons.&nbsp; For a long
time they withstood them victoriously, having secured all the
ancient &ldquo;Brittannia Secunda&rdquo; (now called Wales) from
the ravages of these invaders, and to them the poor Britons, and
more especially the clergy, fled for protection.</p>
<p>It is difficult to trace the exact date of the foundation of
the church of St. Cybi at Holyhead, but it appears to have been
founded by Cybi the <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>son of Selyt, or Solomon, about 550 A.D.&nbsp; He
afterwards, according to tradition, became Bishop of
Anglesey.</p>
<p>Sir John Stanley upheld the theory that a Roman Temple
originally existed within the present churchyard walls, and that
on the departure of the Romans it was occupied or used as a
church.&nbsp; Whether this were so or not, it is clear that in
the days of Caswallan Llaw Hir, Son of Cynetha, there was a
burial-place within the fort at Holyhead, inside the present
walls encircling the churchyard.</p>
<p>Here Caswallan routed and slew with his own hand Sirigi, the
Irish giant, who, with a following of Irish Picts, had a short
time before forced a landing and had built a place or town called
first Llan-y-Gwyddel, then Caer Gybi, and now in English,
Holyhead.&nbsp; Within the enclosure where Sirigi was slain stood
a chapel, on the south side of the church, some remains of which
(conspicuous among them a Gothic arch) are still extant, and
here, it is affirmed, the Irish giant was buried.&nbsp; This was
called Eglwys-y-Bedd, the Church of the Grave, and Capel
Llan-y-Gwyddel, or the Chapel of the Irishman.</p>
<p>It appears, from leases of the collegiate church, that this
chapel was endowed with distinct revenues in the reign of Edward
III.&nbsp; Some of the ruins were removed in the last century to
render the entrance to the present church more convenient, and in
digging, a stone coffin was found under an <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>arch, on the
north side of the chancel, containing bones of a large size, and
this probably was the shrine of Sirigi, who was canonized by the
Irish.&nbsp; According to an old chronicle, they carried off his
body and deposited it in their cathedral in Dublin; but the
finding of the coffin with the gigantic bones seems to render
this part of the story improbable.</p>
<p>Caswallon had apparently a very fierce conflict with the Irish
Picts before he gained his victory, and moreover could not have
had much confidence in his own men, for we read that he tied them
together in couples, with horse fetters, to prevent their
breaking their ranks when fighting with Sirigi.&nbsp; This prince
settled himself after his victories at Llaneillan, and was
submitted to as Chief or King of Anglesey.&nbsp; There are
remains of a strongly fortified camp near the summit of Holyhead
mountain, still called Mur Caswallon or Caer-y-Twr.</p>
<p>Caswallon&rsquo;s son was the famous Maelgwyn Gwynedd, the
hero of many battles and the terror of the Saxons.&nbsp; He
erected the See of Bangor about the year 550, where, a short time
before, Daniel, the son of Dionothus, Abbot of Bangor-is-Coed,
had built a college for North Wales clergy.&nbsp; Maelgwyn
Gwynydd founded the college and the three canonries of Bangor,
Penmon and Caer Gybi.&nbsp; Others say that Llywarch-ap-Bran
founded the Prebendaries.&nbsp; His arms, the three crows, are in
the porch of St. Cybi&rsquo;s Church, at Holyhead.</p>

<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Tradition
makes St. Cybi a contemporary of St. Seiriol, who lived at
Penmon, while St. Cybi lived at Holyhead.&nbsp; These saints met
frequently in the centre of the island to hold holy converse
together.&nbsp; They left their homes early and parted at
mid-day, so that the rising sun always shone on the face of St.
Cybi as he travelled eastwards in the morning, and he met the
rays of the setting sun as he journeyed homeward in the evening,
while on St. Seiriol&rsquo;s face the sun never shone, hence St.
Seiriol is represented as fair and white, while St. Cybi is
depicted as dark and sunburnt. (&ldquo;Gybi Felyn.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>This legend has been commemorated in the following verses by
Mr. Matthew Arnold:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">EAST AND WEST.</p>
<p>In the bare midst of Anglesea they show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two springs which close by one another play,<br />
And &ldquo;Thirteen hundred years agone,&rdquo; they say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two saints met often where those waters flow.</p>
<p>One came from Penmon westward, and a glow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whiten&rsquo;d his face from the sun&rsquo;s
fronting ray;<br />
Eastward the other, from the dying day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he with unsunn&rsquo;d face did always go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seiriol the bright, Cybi the dark!&rdquo; men said;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The seer from the east was then in light,<br />
The seer from the west was then in shade.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah! now &rsquo;tis changed.&nbsp; In conquering
sunshine bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The man of the bold west now comes array&rsquo;d;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He of the mystic east is touched with night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>It is
highly probable that St. Cybi did found the church that bears his
name, though the structure as it stands is no doubt of later
date.&nbsp; The original fabric was probably used as a school or
college as well as for public worship.&nbsp; St. Cybi also
founded other chapels: Capel-y-Llochwydd (meaning a desolate
place), on the mountain, and Capel-y-Golles, at the east end of
which there was a spring; and another at Towyn-y-Capel, on an
artificial tumulus or mound by the sea-shore, about two and a
half miles from Holyhead, called St. Fraid (or Capel
Bridget).&nbsp; The legend states that St. Bridget, escaping from
her persecutors, floated across from Ireland on a green sod
which, on her landing, became a firm hillock, on which the chapel
was built.&nbsp; Traces of a chapel can still be remembered, but
these have now disappeared, owing to the encroachment of the sea,
together with the mound on which they were discernible.&nbsp;
There was also a fourth chapel in the hamlet of Criccist.</p>
<p>The following account of Capel-y-Llochwydd, from the pen of
the late Bishop Stanley, will be of interest.&nbsp;
(&ldquo;Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine,&rdquo; 1830.)</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A singular fissure, cleaved in a direct
line from the summit to the base, forms, or rather did form, a
passage of communication, of no small celebrity in ancient days,
and retaining its odour of sanctity till a very recent
date.&nbsp; It is known by the name of Ogof Llochwyd,
&lsquo;Ogof&rsquo; signifying a cave.&nbsp; A <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>spring of
crystal water, filtering through the deep strata, formed a deep
well at the bottom of this chasm.&nbsp; Situated just at the
higher opening of the gorge was a chapel for the accommodation of
pilgrims, called Capel-y-Llochwyd, which name a considerable
remnant of ruins at the head of the gorge still retains.&nbsp;
Till within 60 years the lonely chapel and its well were from
time unknown the resort of the lads and lassies of the island,
who, at a certain annual festival called
&lsquo;Suliau-y-Creiriau&rsquo;, or &lsquo;The Sundays of the
relics,&rsquo; corresponding to the wakes of the northern
counties of England, and held during three successive Sundays in
July, assembled in troops to ascertain the contingencies awaiting
them.&nbsp; Each diviner into futurity descended the chasm to the
well, and there, if after having taken a mouthful of holy water
and grasped two handfuls of sand from the charmed font, he or she
could accomplish the re-ascent with them safely, each would
obtain the wish of their heart before the close of the
year.&nbsp; About 60 years ago (1770) the chapel was reduced to
ruins, and the well was concealed by filling it up with rubbish,
but till twenty years ago (1810) the walls to the height of seven
or eight feet remained sufficiently entire to convey a tolerable
idea of the perfect building, which is represented to have been a
substantial though rude and simple edifice, composed of unhewn
stones, cemented with mortar, the windows and door-frames
excepted, which were well wrought by the <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>chisel, with
considerable labour, from some very obdurate material, the whole
apparently consisting of one chamber of oblong form not exceeding
a few yards in length.&nbsp; Of the well, however, not a trace
was left, though its existence was proved beyond a shadow of
doubt, a few years ago, by a party who landed and at length
succeeded in detecting the spot from which, after removing a
quantity of sand and loose stones, again gushed the fountain of
pure water in its pristine vigour and doubtless inherent
virtues!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Holyhead or St. Cybi became the centre for all these chapels,
and there priests and holy men could assemble in conference and
also preach the Word of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most of these saints
had their Nauddvan or Sanctuaries, in ancient times supported by
certain tenures and lands which were held of neither Prince nor
Lord, but of certain saints or patrons of churches calling
themselves abbots.&nbsp; Of these there were seven in Anglesey
that were entitled (<i>in capite</i>) to several tenures, viz.:
St. Beuno, St. Cybi, St. Cadwallader, St. Peirio, St. Cyngar, St.
Marcutus or Mechell, St. Elian, this last being largely endowed
in land.&nbsp; These tenures were so bestowed in order that
places of refuge or sanctuaries might be provided, and that the
persons taking refuge therein might have their privileges and
rights preserved and kept inviolate.&rdquo;&nbsp; (See
&ldquo;Mona Antiqua.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>After the dissolution of the monasteries the <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>revenues of
Holyhead, Bodedern, Llandrygarn, and Bodwrog parishes came to Dr.
Thomas Gwynn, whose heir, about A.D. 1648, gave them to Jesus
College, Oxford.</p>
<p>Grose, in his &ldquo;Antiquities of England and Wales,&rdquo;
in 1786, writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;St. Cybi, the Collegiate Church of
Holyhead, stands at the extreme western corner of Holyhead
Island, in a quadrangle measuring 220 feet by 130 feet, three
sides of which are enclosed by strong walls, seventeen feet high
and six thick.&nbsp; The fourth side is open to the sea, having
only a parapet, but is defended by steep rocks.&nbsp; At each
corner of the wall is an oval tower (two of which are seen in the
accompanying view).&nbsp; The entrance to this area is through a
rude stone gate, the masonry of which, and also of the walls and
towers, is said by Mr. Pennant to be &lsquo;evidently
Roman.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Along the walls,&rsquo; he adds
&lsquo;are two rows of round holes, about four inches in
diameter, which penetrate them.&nbsp; They are like those of
Segontium (Caernarvon), and nicely plaistered
within.&rsquo;&nbsp; The church is dedicated to St. Cybi.&nbsp;
It is a handsome embattled edifice, built in the form of a
cross.&nbsp; The inside of the porch and the outside part of the
transept are rudely ornamented with grotesque figures.&nbsp; On
the outside of the last are dragons, and a man leading a bear
with a rope, or as some suppose it, Balaam and his Ass, with
other now shapeless sculptures.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;Maelgwyn Gwynedd, who lived about A.D. 580, is
said to have founded a college here.&nbsp; This Prince was styled
&lsquo;Draco Insularis.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps the dragon engraven
on the church may allude to him.&nbsp; Others assert that the
founder of this college was Hwfa Cynddelew, Lord of Llys Lliven
in this island, and of one of the fifteen tribes who lived in the
time of Griffith-ap-Conan, Prince of North Wales, and Owen, his
son, about the former part of the twelfth century.&nbsp; It
certainly was in being before the year 1291, because it was rated
in the Lincoln taxation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The head of the college was called Penclos, or
Pencolas, and was one of the three spiritual Lords of
Anglesey.&nbsp; The Archdeacon of the Isle, and the Abbot of
Penmon were the two others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Latin title of the superior of this college was
Rector, as appears by an ancient seal inscribed &lsquo;Sigillum
Rectoris et capituli ecclesia de Caer Gybi.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
number of prebendaries of which this college consisted is not
known; but it is certain there were twelve at least, that number
being found in the Pension List in 1553 at &pound;1 each.&nbsp;
Before the dissolution, the Rector, or Provost, for so he is also
styled, had thirty-nine marks; one chaplain had eleven, and the
other two the same between them.&nbsp; At the dissolution (26
Henry VIII.) the whole revenues were valued at no more than
&pound;24, as stated by both Dugdale and Speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;The King had the gift of the Provostship, which
Edward III. bestowed on his chaplain, Thomas de London, under the
denomination of the &lsquo;Provostship of his free chapel of Caer
Cybe,&rsquo; for which the King, in 1351, dispensed with him for
services to himself.&nbsp; This college was granted, 7 James I.,
by that King to Francis Morris and Francis Phillips.&nbsp; It
became afterwards the property of Rice Gwynn, Esquire, who, in
1648, bestowed it on Jesus College, Oxford, the great tithes for
the maintenance of two fellows and as many scholars; and since
that time the parish has been served by a curate nominated by the
college.&nbsp; The living is a donative, not in charge, the
certified value &pound;35.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Mr. Grose described the Church of St. Cybi with pen and
pencil 111 years ago many changes have taken place.&nbsp; The
shore below the church has been reclaimed from the sea, the lower
churchyard has been added to the original enclosure, a broad road
separates it from the present harbour, and where the tide once
flowed, under the old churchyard wall, the extensive buildings of
the London and North Western Railway Company now stand.&nbsp;
Steamers and trains laden with passengers and merchandise passing
to and from Ireland and America crowd the once lonely shore; and
the town and its population have grown with the growth of
trade.&nbsp; The very aspect and dress of <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the people
have changed, the picturesque high-crowned hats and long cloaks
have disappeared, only the Welsh language remains, &ldquo;Yr hen
iaith Gymraig,&rdquo; nor does it diminish its hold on the
affections of the people.</p>
<p>The successive changes which the country has undergone have
left their mark on St. Cybi&rsquo;s Church, the most enduring of
all the buildings in Caer Gybi.&nbsp; It was rebuilt during the
14th century, during the reign of Edward III., as appears by the
arms of England and France cut out in a stone near the porch, and
stones are in the walls worked as if belonging to a former
building.&nbsp; The east window is of that date.&nbsp; The church
was practically rebuilt again in the time of Henry VII., though
the beautiful plan then conceived was not fully carried
out.&nbsp; The Tudor cognizances are carved on the frieze of the
church, under the battlements, with St. Cybi&rsquo;s name, and
the inscription on the north side is still quite legible,
&ldquo;Sanctus Kebius ora pro nobis.&rdquo;&nbsp; The steeple was
rebuilt in the 17th century.&nbsp; The choir in 1713, when the
tomb of Roderic ap Owen was discovered, and on the coffin a small
brass bell curiously wrought through network; the date of his
death was 1175. <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"

<p>The ruins of the chapel (Capel Llan-y-Gwyddel) <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>mentioned as
standing south of St. Cybi&rsquo;s Church, within the enclosure,
were converted into a public school by Chancellor Edward Wynn,
LL.D., of Bodewryd in Anglesey, who by bond, bearing date
November 25th, 1748, endowed it with a capital of &pound;120;
&ldquo;the interest whereof is to be paid annually on the 24th
November to a schoolmaster, who is to teach six poor boys of the
town to read and write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Light is thrown upon the wants and difficulties of the last
century, in matters of education, by some letters from the Rev.
T. Ellis, Rector of Holyhead, to Chancellor Wynn&rsquo;s sister,
Madame Owen of Penrhos.</p>
<p>In January, 1745, he writes:&mdash;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing my heart is so much set upon as seeing ye
Chancellor&rsquo;s school brought to perfection, which I hope in
God, it will be soon, thro&rsquo; yr means, and I really believe
it would be ye best work that has been done in ys county for
perhaps three hundred years past . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following old proverbs will be admitted for my
excuse,&mdash;&lsquo;Ple caffo y Cymro, y cais.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Y neb a fo ddi gwylydd, a fydd ddi golled.&rsquo;&nbsp; My
humble request is that you&rsquo;ll be so kind as to send orders
pr bearer to finish ye floor of the School, and to plaster and
whitewash ye walls, (which look exceeding ugly at present) and to
make a large oak table for writing, wch will make ye place quite
compleat to the Chancellor&rsquo;s liking, wn he <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>comes to view
it (as I hope he will) after his return from Hereford.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d not be so bold a beggar and put on ye Irishman in this
manner, but for my real concern for ye swarm of children, wch
grow in a manner wild for want of schooling, who I hope will
thro&rsquo; yr means be put in a way of serving God and man. . .
. &rdquo;</p>
<p>January, 1746:&mdash;&ldquo;As the school is always uppermost
in my head and heart, I can&rsquo;t forbear mentioning it to you,
who are so good as to sympathise wth ye Parish and me on its
account.&nbsp; I fear the Chancellor thinks me troublesome and is
offended at my frequent applications, else I would have been wth
you long agoe.&nbsp; What to do I don&rsquo;t know, I must not
speak to him about it, it seems, tho&rsquo; as it were ready to
burst, in spight of all the patience I preach to myself and
others. . . .&nbsp; It is time to give an account of my
stewardship of yr four guineas you entrusted to my care for the
benefit of this Parish.&nbsp; Out of the first two guineas there
went for the Bible &pound;1 4 0, for the folio Common Prayer-book
13s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, Mr. Ellis writes to Madam Owen thus:&mdash;&ldquo;I
shew&rsquo;d T. Edwards yr memorandum of yr Brother&rsquo;s
promising the sum of two hundred pounds to ye School dated May ye
1st, 1745. . . .&nbsp; Please to present my respects to ye
Chancellor and to ask him if he would be offended at a Volunteer
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>Master&rsquo;s being put in ye School to take his chance
till Providence sends an endowment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . I&rsquo;ve sent the Chancellor herewith a present
of 2 London discourses.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m employed by ye Society
for promoting Xtian Knowledge to procure subscriptions towds
printing ye 15,000 Welch Bibles, wch are now in ye Press.&nbsp;
As Anglesey is call&rsquo;d of old &ldquo;Mam Cymru&rdquo; or
Mother of Wales, she&rsquo;ll set her daughters (viz. ye other
Counties) a good example on ys excellent occasion, wch will
otherwise be a great reproach to ye Welch, who but for ye charity
of ye English wd in a few years have scarce any such things as a
Welch Bible among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>January, 1747:&mdash;&ldquo;Please tell the Chancellor that I
acquainted the Society with his &pound;10 subscription and
communicate to him the following good news, wch will give him
pleasure, viz.: that the Society has at last got in benefactions
enough to defray the whole expence of the impression of the Welch
Bibles (except ye binding), and yt is expected it will be
finished before Lady Day next.&nbsp; According to ye good old
custom I heartily wish you all a happy new year and many.&nbsp;
Your obliged servant to command, Thos. Ellis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The successive owners of Penrhos were closely connected with
the fortunes of Holyhead.&nbsp; Sir John Stanley, afterwards
first Lord Stanley of Alderley, <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>his brother, the accomplished Bishop
of Norwich and their sons, the Honorable W. O. Stanley, and
Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Dean of Westminster, took the keenest
interest in chronicling the facts and legends connected with the
venerable church, and in the preservation of its fabric.</p>
<p>During the last months of Mrs. Stanley&rsquo;s life it was her
great interest to plan a complete restoration of the church, to
complete the clerestory left unfinished in Tudor times, and to
render the dilapidated building once more a worthy sanctuary for
the prayers and praises which had echoed within its walls for
over thirteen centuries.&nbsp; Mrs. Stanley&rsquo;s plan included
the erection of a monument to the husband she had loved so well,
and whose life had been devoted to the welfare of Holyhead.</p>
<p>The restoration of the church was carried out after her death
from the plans of Sir Gilbert Scott, mainly at the expense of Mr.
Stanley, in 1879.&nbsp; By the removal of the earth accumulated
within the building, the bases of the pillars long buried were
brought to light, and the church revealed once more in the beauty
of its original proportions.&nbsp; And now Mrs. Stanley&rsquo;s
last wish has been fully carried out, as regards her
husband&rsquo;s monument, by its erection in a fitting shrine by
one who, having filled a daughter&rsquo;s place in the home at
Penrhos, has put her whole heart into the perfecting of a work
which she regarded as a sacred trust bequeathed to her.</p>

<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>The
south chancel aisle was completed and unveiled on Sunday, the
20th June, 1897, the 60th anniversary of the Queen&rsquo;s
Accession.&nbsp; The carved figures on the outside representing
St. Seiriol and St. Cybi, are from the designs of Mr. Hamo
Thornycroft; the steps, of green serpentine marble, are taken
from the Rhoscolyn Quarry, Holyhead Island, by the kindness of
Colonel Hampton Lewis of Bodior.</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur Baker, who carried out the restoration of 1877
under Sir Gilbert Scott, has been the architect of the present
addition; but to the deep regret of all who knew him, he has
passed away this year, and we owe the perfecting and completion
of the work to the devoted personal superintendance of his
partner, and son-in-law, Mr. Harold Hughes, of Bangor.</p>
<p>The monument itself is of Carrara marble, designed by Hamo
Thornycroft, R.A.&nbsp; It consists of a life-size recumbent
figure with watching angels at the head and the feet.&nbsp; With
the help of Mr. Watts, R.A., and his knowledge of the original,
the sculptor has produced a wonderful likeness, recalling to all
who knew him the characteristics of Mr. Stanley&rsquo;s fine head
and impressive features.&nbsp; Mr. Watts, who has himself
followed the progress of the memorial for many years with keen
interest, considers it one of the finest works of art of modern
times.</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>The
inscription runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>William Owen Stanley of Penrhos, Lord Lieutenant
of Anglesey, for 34 years a Member of the House of Commons, twin
son of the 1st Lord Stanley of Alderley and his wife Lady Maria
Josepha Holroyd.&nbsp; Born 1802, Married 1832, Ellin, daughter
of Sir John Williams, Baronet, of Bodelwyddan.&nbsp; Died 1884,
and buried in this Church, whereof he restored the fabric.&nbsp;
A scholar and an antiquary, he dwelt among his own people in the
Island of Holyhead, and gave a long life to their welfare.</p>
<p>Erected by the desire of Ellin, for 44 years his devoted
wife.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the arch of the recess behind the tomb are engraved these
words: &ldquo;Till the day dawn and the shadows flee
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stanley&rsquo;s wish that there should be no monument to
herself has been respected, but the effigy of her husband has
been encircled with wrought ironwork, entirely formed of her
initials E and S intertwined, an idea suggested by St.
Anselm&rsquo;s Chapel in Canterbury Cathedral.&nbsp; The stained
glass windows were designed by Sir E. Burne Jones and executed by
William Morris, and one of them bears the inscription: &ldquo;To
the dear memory of Ellin Stanley, died at Penrhos, November,
1876.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>This
aisle, as a tribute to their joint memories, is now dedicated to

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have been reading for several
Sundays in church the history of the Patriarchs.&nbsp; The words
of the Prophet which I have taken for my text give us the key to
that history.&nbsp; We all know the value of the graces and gifts
we derive from our families.&nbsp; Who is there that does not
recognise in himself or in those about him what has come to him
and them from father, mother&mdash;nay, it may even be
grandfather or great-grandfather, uncle and aunt&mdash;or what
may be breathed again into him by brother, sister, cousin.&nbsp;
These, if anything in the world, are gifts to us from
without.&nbsp; These, if anything, are gifts from God.&nbsp; What
we drink in, as we say, with our mother&rsquo;s milk our
mother&rsquo;s tongue, our mother&rsquo;s faith and prayers, it
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>may be,
our mother&rsquo;s character; what we have had impressed upon us
of our father&rsquo;s spirit, of our &ldquo;fatherland,&rdquo; of
our father&rsquo;s blood&mdash;the innocent joys, the tragical
sorrows of home and household;&mdash;these are the materials out
of which our souls and spirits are fashioned.&nbsp; We may have
our own personal character besides, but without these our
characters would not be what they are.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Now, what is thus true of the family in respect of
individuals, is true of races of men in respect both of nations
and individuals; and this is one lesson which those early
chapters in the Book of Genesis impress upon us.&nbsp; They tell
us of the family.&nbsp; But, over and above this, they tell us of
the race; they tell us of the immense importance to the
Israelites, and through them to us, of the fact that they sprang
from no ignoble or commonplace nation, but from those whom God
had specially selected for His work on earth&mdash;from the tribe
of Jacob, from the seed of Abraham, from the race of Shem.&nbsp;
This is the true &ldquo;predestination&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s
counsels; this is the true &ldquo;election&rdquo; of the chosen
vessels.&nbsp; Race and nationality, as well as family, are the
precious gifts of God, to be used and recognised and taken
account of as amongst the mighty moving powers of the
world.&nbsp; If we wish to see what work we or others are called
to do, we must not forget to look back to the ancient rock from
whence we are hewn, and the deep pit from whence we are
digged.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>There
is also the lesson which all such inquiries bring before us, and
which is specially impressed upon us by these early records of
the Bible&mdash;the advantage of being transported to remote ages
and scenes wholly unlike our own.&nbsp; In those stories of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob there is a freshness as of the dew of
the womb of the morning.&nbsp; We feel younger as we read; they
refresh us in the weary pilgrimage of life; we catch the early
fragrance of the first dawn of the human race.&nbsp; There had
been many great epochs and many great men in Israel since the
time of Abraham and Sarah: there had been Jacob, or Israel, from
whom they derived their name and some of the chief elements of
their character; there had been Moses, under whom they had won
their freedom and their laws, and Joshua, by whose prowess they
had conquered the Promised Land, and David, with all the line of
kings and prophets that followed.&nbsp; But still there was a
charm about their first ancestor, Abraham, and their first
mother, Sarah, which they could find in no later times.&nbsp;
There was a delight in seeing the peculiar blessings which they
had gained from those old primitive patriarchs, and for which
they were to be ever thankful to God, through whom these and all
other gifts had come.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; May I take up the Prophet&rsquo;s words and the
lessons of the Book of Genesis, and give them a special
application which this day suggests.&nbsp; We <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>are met to
celebrate the reopening of one of the most ancient churches of
the Welsh people.&nbsp; Most of the building has stood for five
hundred years&mdash;one aged arch, we are told, for a thousand
years. <a name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a>&nbsp; Let us then, Englishmen or
Welshmen, who are assembled here, ask, in no spirit of
boastfulness or rivalry, but of thankfulness to God, what are the
special gifts for good which the British Celtic race has
contributed to our common country?&nbsp; As the Israelites had
for their ancestors Abraham and Sarah, before their own special
patriarch Israel or Jacob&mdash;ancestors by whom they were
connected with other races besides their own, Edomite, Arabian,
Mesopotamian&mdash;so we were Britons before we were Englishmen;
and we by that Celtic parentage are made one in blood with that
old original people which is parent alike to the Welsh, the
Irish, the Scottish, and the French nations.</p>
<p>What, then, are the best peculiarities of the Welsh
people?</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; To the ancient Cambrian British race we owe that
distant atmosphere of romance, of sentiment, of poetry, which
neither Saxon nor Norman have given or could have given us.</p>
<p>These mountains and vales and creeks and bays, the refuge of
the ancient inhabitants retreating before <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>the invader,
have retained, even in their very names and forms, a poetic
inspiration which has elsewhere passed away.</p>
<p>The four Welsh dioceses each of them speak of this poetic,
mystic past.&nbsp; That marvellous cathedral of St.
David&rsquo;s, in its secluded basin at the very extremity of the
land, shut out from the world and enclosed as within a natural
sanctuary, with its craggy coast and headland and island and
glistening shore and purple cliff, every spring and bay and inlet
teeming with some strange legend of those primitive days of David
and Nun and Lily; or, again, that lovely cathedral of St. Teilo,
on the banks of the Taff, in its green vale, with its crystal
stream and its solemn yews; or, again, that lesser cathedral of
St. Asaph, founded by the most romantic of all the saints of the
Celtic race of the north&mdash;the darling Mungo of the Scottish
nation&mdash;founded as he wandered to and from his own Glasgow
on the Clyde; or, again, this diocese in which we are now
assembled, with Snowdon as the guardian mount that stands round
about its small Jerusalem, this ancient refuge of the Druids and
Bards of old from the Roman conqueror, this Holy Mount of the
Holy Island of Mona, stretching out its arms to the neighbouring
shore of Ireland, another Isle of Saints:&mdash;Look at all these
ancient sanctuaries, east and west, north and south.&nbsp; Look
at the rock from which we were hewn and the deep pit from which
we were digged.&nbsp; Despise not these <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>feelings
which God by a thousand marks has stamped with His own peculiar
approval.&nbsp; Cherish these venerable ruins and monuments of
early times.</p>
<p>There is a legend which tells us that if we take a clod of
turf from St. David&rsquo;s churchyard, and stand upon it by the
shore of that western sea, we shall see rising in the distant
waters the green islands of the fairies, the vision of a land,
not indeed of heaven, but still not of this earth.&nbsp; It is by
taking our stand on that old British soil that we can catch for
ourselves a glimpse of a higher, more romantic, ideal world than
any other part of English history can show.&nbsp; The Bards,
indeed, themselves have perished&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Cold is Cadwallo&rsquo;s tongue<br />
That hush&rsquo;d the stormy main;<br />
Brave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bed;<br />
Mountains, ye mourn in vain<br />
Modred, whose magic song<br />
Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-topt head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the world which they created still lives in that
marvellous cycle of legends which gather round the name of King
Arthur, and which, in our own day, has given to the first of our
living poets the worthiest subject which our island could
furnish&mdash;the career of the stainless king and his gallant
knights, which our children and our children&rsquo;s children
will read with their souls more and more raised to nobler and
higher thoughts.&nbsp; The rocks <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>and seas on which we look from
Holyhead&mdash;&ldquo;the shaggy top of Mona
high,&rdquo;&mdash;the wide bay &ldquo;where Deva spreads her
wizard stream,&rdquo; inspired in Milton some of his wildest and
most pathetic strains in speaking of his loved companion Lycidas,
who was lost off these very coasts.&nbsp; The solid prosaic sense
of the Saxon is necessary; the energy and enterprise of the
Norman is useful; have been indispensable to the greatness of
Britain; but do not forget the romance and the song and the
sentiment of the mountains and the minstrels of Wales.&nbsp;
Leave a corner in your minds for the visions of other days.&nbsp;
Remember that there are things in heaven and earth more than our
plain homely English philosophy has dreamed of.&nbsp; Such
innocent, beautiful stories and thoughts, from whatever quarter
they come, though not in themselves religious, yet smooth and
purify the course of life.&nbsp; They prepare us for the poetry
of parables like the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&mdash;they prepare
us for the poetry of the Psalms and of the Prophets of the
Bible.&nbsp; As these mountains, these bays, these rocks, which
gave to us in their early days our poetic and romantic thoughts,
have, in these later days, given to us our quarries and our
harbours and our lighthouses and our piers, so it is that out of
every generous and inspiring thought there may come at last the
most solid, the most useful, the most comprehensive materials of
God&rsquo;s glory and man&rsquo;s usefulness.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>(2)&nbsp; There is another aspect of this element in the
national character of the old Celtic races.</p>
<p>I have said that the names of the old Welsh saints remind us
of the antique poetic phase of the national British Church.&nbsp;
But they also remind us of its devotional emotions and fervent
enthusiasm.&nbsp; We know but little of St. Cybi or St.
Seiriol&mdash;those gaunt hermits, wrapped up in shaggy
goat-skins, with their sacred bells and their favourite
animals.&nbsp; But we know thus much&mdash;that they were amongst
the enthusiastic spirits who appeared in those dark times to keep
up by a strange unearthly presence the sense of things
unseen.&nbsp; And such as they were, with their childish visions
and their solitary musings, such was the old British Church
altogether&mdash;hardly ever leaving a permanent impression on
the great practical world without, though producing now and then
a holy prelate like St. David, now and then a holy anchorite like
St. Cybi, now and then a holy heresiarch like Pelagius.&nbsp; And
so in later times, the same passionate religious sentiment has
shown itself in the fervour with which the Welsh people received
the ministrations and the influence of John Wesley and George
Whitefield, and the affection with which they clung to the hymns
of their own rude Methodist poets.&nbsp; Amidst much folly and
much obstinacy and much waywardness, all honour to those old
saints who achieved what the Norman prelates could not
achieve,&mdash;to those Methodist <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>teachers who reached classes which
perhaps could not have been reached by better and wiser men.</p>
<p>Such enthusiasm is not sufficient by itself to produce true
religion; it is compatible with a very imperfect morality and a
very low stage of Christianity.&nbsp; Still it belongs to the
great central fires which keep the human soul alive, and it has
in various forms been God&rsquo;s special gift to the Celtic
races of mankind, especially in this country.&nbsp; If we were to
remove it out of our national existence England would not be the
great nation that she now is, and the English Church would lose
one powerful means of raising the spiritual energies of the
people.&nbsp; &ldquo;Prove all things,&rdquo; says the Apostle,
and &ldquo;hold fast that which is good&rdquo;; but in the same
breath, he says, &ldquo;Quench not the spirit,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Despise not prophesyings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Quench not
enthusiasm, despise not strong emotions: labour only to turn them
into proper channels, so that they may help to make men more pure
and more truthful&mdash;more near to God, more like to
Christ.&nbsp; It is not only in the worship and teaching of our
country that this enthusiasm shows itself.&nbsp; Listen to the
account of the gallant deeds of Welsh soldiers, in the letter of
an English officer writing to a friend, <a
name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a> describing the defence of Rorke&rsquo;s
Drift:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Private John Williams was posted, together
with Private Joseph Williams and Private William Harrison, in a
further <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>ward of the hospital.&nbsp; They held it for more than
an hour&mdash;so long as they had a round of ammunition left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When communication was for a time cut off, the Zulus
were enabled to advance and burst open the door.&nbsp; A
hand-to-hand conflict then ensued, during which Private Joseph
Williams and two of the patients were dragged out and
assegaied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst the Zulus were occupied with the slaughter of
those unfortunate men, a lull took place, which enabled Private
John Williams (who with two of the patients were the only men
left alive in the ward) to succeed in knocking a hole in the
partition and taking the two patients with him into the next
ward, where he found Private Henry Hook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These two men together, one man working whilst the
other fought and held the enemy at bay with his bayonet, broke
through three more partitions, and were thus enabled to bring
eight more patients through a small window into the inner line of
defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In another ward facing the hill Private William Jones
and Private Robert Jones had been placed.&nbsp; They defended
their post to the last, and till six out of seven patients had
been removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal William Allen and Frederick Hitch must also be
mentioned.&nbsp; It was chiefly due to their courageous conduct
that communication with the hospital was kept up at all, holding
together at all costs a most dangerous post, raked in reverse by
the enemy&rsquo;s fire from the hill.&nbsp; They were both
severely wounded, but their determined conduct enabled the
patients to be withdrawn from the hospital, and when
incapacitated by their wounds from fighting, they continued, as
soon as their wounds were dressed, to serve out ammunition to
their comrades through the night.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Welshmen all of them.</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>That is
the determined enthusiasm which all Welshmen ought to show not
only in the battlefield, but against our worst foes at
home&mdash;the foes of intemperance and dishonesty and hypocrisy
and deceitfulness.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; There is one more addition which the Welsh people,
the British element of our race, has made to the course of
English history.&nbsp; There is something in the Celtic blood,
something in the Cambrian stock, which, mingling with the Saxon
and Norman races, has unquestionably produced a larger result,
such as without it would, humanly speaking, have been difficult
or impossible.&nbsp; That poetic refinement, that spiritual
fervour, of which I have already spoken, has, for the most part,
been nourished by seclusion from the active world.&nbsp; Yet
there was one channel in which the old British character
displayed itself that directly bore on practical
life&mdash;namely, the quick temper, the vivacious intelligence,
which impart to other useful qualities exactly the stimulus they
most need.&nbsp; Not seldom can we trace in families the sudden
turn given to a sluggish, steady, stagnant stock of purely
English extraction by contact with the imaginative, lively,
mercurial character of Welsh or Celtic parentage.&nbsp; And what
is thus seen in private life may be also faintly traced in the
great course of our national history.</p>
<p>I will not speak of individuals, though I might <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>mention that
two of the most stirring characters who ever filled the office of
Dean of Westminster were Welshmen: one was Gabriel Goodman, one
of the translators of the Bible, friend of Lord Burleigh; the
other was John Williams, who in his earlier days was twice
committed to the Tower, once by the King, and once by the
Parliament, who defended the Castle of Conway against the army of
the Commonwealth, and who now after his stormy life reposes in
the lovely church of Llandegai, the last ecclesiastical Lord
Keeper of Great Britain.</p>
<p>But there is a more general influence which has left its
permanent mark on England.&nbsp; Within that old cathedral of St.
David, of which I just now spoke, the most conspicuous tomb which
rises in the midst of it, and which, according to the tradition
of the place, saved the cathedral itself from destruction, is
that of Edmund Tudor, father of Henry VII. and grandfather of
Henry VIII., who, for its sake, spared the venerable church where
it stands.&nbsp; This very church of Holyhead was in great part
rebuilt in the time of Henry VII. son of that Edmund Tudor.&nbsp;
The rose of the Tudor family is visible to this day on its
walls.&nbsp; Owen Tudor, the ancestor of them all, was a native
of this island of Anglesey.&nbsp; We are thus reminded of the
fact, which we sometimes forget, that, after Saxon and Norman and
Plantagenet had done their best and passed away, a Welsh and
British dynasty at last was seated once more on the throne of
Britain, <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>and swayed the destinies of the whole empire.</p>
<p>When in Westminster Abbey we pass from the tombs of the
earlier kings to the magnificent chapel of King Henry VII., it is
a striking thought to any one, especially to any one who has a
drop of the ancient Welsh blood in his veins, that he enters
there on a new field of the history of England, inaugurated by a
succession of princes whose boast it was to be descended, not
from Edward the Confessor or William the Conqueror, but from
Arthur and Llewellyn, and that about the tomb of the first Tudor
sovereign, intertwined with the emblems of his English descent,
is to be seen the Red Dragon of Cadwallader.</p>
<p>That Tudor race, in their quick understanding, in their fiery
temper, the true representatives of their ancient Celtic lineage,
were the instruments raised up by God&rsquo;s providence at the
critical season of the new birth of England in the Reformation,
for guiding, stimulating, freshening the Church and the nation to
the performance of new duties, the fulfilment of new hopes, the
application of new truths.</p>
<p>The sharpness of wit and liveliness of mind which were amongst
the precocious gifts of Henry and Edward and Elizabeth, were
common to them with their Welsh ancestors, and contributed in no
small degree to the fresh start which England then made in the
movements of that moving age.&nbsp; <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>These qualities, whenever found,
though they are not the highest of gifts, are inestimable for
enlivening, cheering, enkindling the more powerful and the more
highly civilised to action and to enquiry.&nbsp; Cherish them,
even if they sometimes outrun discretion; correct them, if so be,
not by repressing them, but by striving to develop the opposite
gifts which are needed to balance and to chasten them.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; And this leads us to two general remarks in
conclusion.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; First let us remember that these graces of the
Cambrian or Celtic character, which our Heavenly Father has thus
vouchsafed to us, are also by His good providence blended in the
English race with exactly those qualities which furnish their
counterpoise&mdash;with that self-control, that moral discipline,
that solid steadiness of purpose, without which poetic sentiment,
religious fervour, mental vivacity are often useless, or worse
than useless.</p>
<p>The old hermit in his solitude, the preacher in his fervid
appeal, was good; but the honest, manly Christian, doing his duty
faithfully and truthfully in his own station of life, is
better.&nbsp; The sailor who remembers on the broad sea that
God&rsquo;s eye is always upon him; the workman or tradesman who
endeavours to render to his Maker the best of all services, the
offering of honest labour, the offering of unadulterated food,
the offering of an upright <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>conscientious traffic; the railway
official or partner who cheers and encourages friendless
travellers by a kindly word or by a helping hand, not for reward,
but for love of his fellow creatures,&mdash;these are the modes
by which, far more than by sudden conversion or enthusiastic
hymns, we can fulfil God&rsquo;s goodwill towards us.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; Another remark, still more obvious, but one of which
we sometimes lose sight in speaking of the good influences of
race and nationality, is that the power of religion, of the
Christian religion, though coloured by these several influences,
is yet above and beyond and independent of them all.&nbsp; I
spoke before of the old story which tells how he who stands on
the turf from St. David&rsquo;s churchyard and looks out on the
western sea was believed to see in the distance the green island
of the fairies.&nbsp; But there is a still better thing that can
be done by each one of us, Saxon or Celt, Englishman or Briton,
old and young, rich and poor.&nbsp; Take your stand on any good
religious lesson, learnt from whatever quarter&mdash;any piece of
fresh fragment of knowledge, cut out of your inner
experience&mdash;a good text from your Bible, a good prayer from
your prayer-book, a good hymn from your hymn-book, a good
counsel, or example of friend or teacher anywhere, which has
enabled you better to know yourself, and better to know what God
is,&mdash;stand fast upon it, and look out over the wide sea of
your future years, and the still wider ocean of eternity <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>beyond, and
from that green turf of duty or of knowledge you will see in the
distance the islands, not of the fairies, but something far
better&mdash;the islands of the blessed, of the eternal shores
across the stormy waves of this troublesome world.</p>
<p>Such an example, such a memory, such a life <a
name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39"
class="citation">[39]</a> you have had in the recollection of her
who devoted her life to the welfare of the people of Holyhead,
who loved the Welsh nation with a constant love, who spoke their
tongue as her own, who cherished all their traditions, who longed
for the restoration of this venerable church, whose heart&rsquo;s
desire has been on this day fulfilled by its reproduction in all
its antique simplicity, in all its gracious adaptation to our
living needs.&nbsp; She was a Welshwoman to the heart&rsquo;s
core; but she was also a generous, loving, wise, Christian
spirit; and when we stand round her grave, and in this church
which is the monument of her goodness, we stand as it were on the
fragment of St. David&rsquo;s turf, and we look out beyond a
wider than any earthly sea to those islands of the better land
where she and the great family of God&rsquo;s servants have gone
before; the islands of eternal rest&mdash;the islands where truth
and holiness have &ldquo;room and verge enough&rdquo; to flourish
undisturbed by earthly tempests, unwarped by the winds of earthly
cares&mdash;in the haven where they and we would all be, through
the grace of God and the power of His Spirit in our Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
